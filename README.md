# Customer Analytics Project (SQL + Visualization)

This project dissects fictitious company sales and customer data using SQL queries and visualizations. 
 
The goal is to understand customer value, cohort dynamics, and churn/retention patterns that drive long-term revenue.

## ðŸ“Š Query 1 â€” Customer Segmentation by Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Story:**  
Customers were grouped into segments based on spending percentiles:  
- **High Value**: â‰¥ 75th percentile  
- **Mid Value**: 25thâ€“75th percentile  
- **Low Value**: â‰¤ 25th percentile  

**Insight:**  
High-value customers spend dramatically more on average compared to mid- and low-value customers. This shows where most of the companyâ€™s lifetime value comes from.

**SQL:** See [`sql/query_01_customer_segmentation.sql`](./sql/query_01_customer_segmentation.sql)  

**Visualizations:**  
- Average LTV by segment:

- Customer distribution across segments:

## ðŸ“ˆ Query 2 â€” Cohort Analysis (First Purchase Year)

**Story:**  
Customers are segmented by their **cohort year** (the year of first purchase). We measure both **customer growth** and **revenue per customer** at acquisition.

**Insight:**  
While the company is acquiring more customers each year, the **revenue per customer is slowly declining**. This suggests we are losing pre-existing customers faster and missing out on maximizing lifetime value.

**SQL:** See [`sql/query_02_cohort_analysis.sql`](./sql/query_02_cohort_analysis.sql)  

**Visualizations:**  
- Total customers by cohort year:  
  ![Total Customers](images/q2_total_customers_by_cohort.png)  
- Revenue per customer by cohort year:  
  ![Revenue per Customer](images/q2_revenue_per_customer_by_cohort.png)

## ðŸ”„ Query 3 â€” Churn & Retention by Cohort

**Story:**  
We classified customers as **Active** or **Churned** based on whether they purchased in the last 6 months relative to the datasetâ€™s snapshot date.  

**Insight:**  
The majority of customers are **Churned**, highlighting missed opportunities to **re-monetize existing customers**.  
This points toward strategies like re-engagement campaigns, loyalty programs, or personalized marketing to lift retention.

**SQL:** See [`sql/query_03_churn_by_cohort.sql`](./sql/query_03_churn_by_cohort.sql)  

**Visualization:**  
- Retention mix (Active vs. Churned) by cohort:
