# Customer Analytics

This project dissects fictitious company sales and customer data using SQL queries and visualizations. 
 
The goal is to understand customer value, cohort dynamics, and churn/retention patterns that drive long-term revenue.

## ðŸ“Š Query 1 â€” Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Story:**  
Customers were grouped into segments based on spending percentiles:  
- **High Value**: â‰¥ 75th percentile  
- **Mid Value**: 25thâ€“75th percentile  
- **Low Value**: â‰¤ 25th percentile  

**Insight:**  
High-value customers spend dramatically more on average compared to mid- and low-value customers. This shows where most of the companyâ€™s lifetime value comes from.

**SQL:** See [`SQL Query #1`](./Queries/1_customer_segmentation.sql)

## ðŸ“ˆ Query 2 â€” Cohort Analysis

**Story:**  
Customers are segmented by their **cohort year** (the year of first purchase). We measure both **customer growth** and **revenue per customer** at acquisition.

**Insight:**  
While the company is acquiring more customers each year, the **revenue per customer is slowly declining**. This suggests we are losing pre-existing customers faster and missing out on maximizing lifetime value.

**SQL:** See [`SQL Query #2`](./Queries/2_cohort_analysis.sql)

## ðŸ”„ Query 3 â€” Churn & Retention

**Story:**  
We classified customers as **Active** or **Churned** based on whether they purchased in the last 6 months relative to the datasetâ€™s snapshot date.  

**Insight:**  
The majority of customers are **Churned**, highlighting missed opportunities to **re-monetize existing customers**.  
This points toward strategies like re-engagement campaigns, loyalty programs, or personalized marketing to lift retention.
